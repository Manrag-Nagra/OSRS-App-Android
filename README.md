# OSRS App Android

This project connects to my RuneScape API server and uses Kotlin to get the current and latest prices for an item and stats for a player. Users can enter an item and see what the current price is and how much it is up or down today. If a user clicks on an item, they get a more detail view, which tells them the change in the past 30, 90, 180 days. 

The user can also use the "HiScores" option to search a player and get the player stats, level, rank, and experience.
